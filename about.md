## Right Design Core Values

* Aim High
  * Anything worth pursuing involves risk. Seek out difficult challenges and heavier burdens to carry.
* Innovation
  * Sometimes innovation comes from what is new. Other times it comes from combining what is old in new ways. Be open to all possible avenues of innovation.
* Synergy
  * Cross pollinate across practice areas to build on the best ideas and gain new insights.
* Integrity
  * Build trust by keeping your commitments. Make it as right as possible when you cannot or do not.
* Humility
  * False humility is thinking low of yourself. True humility is discovering and owning what you are capable of, and then leveraging that in service to others.
* Empathy
  * Maintain a listening and learning posture, even (and especially) toward those with whom you disagree.
* Antifragility
  * Well designed systems gain from chaos and disorder.
* Truth Telling
  * Sometimes the truth is uncomfortable. But the only way to build trust is to be truthful.
* Alignment
  * Practice relentless self- and organizational-evaluation to measure alignment with core values, and course correct where necessary.
* Results
  * Get Things Done. *Tawk* is cheap if your goal is to effect real and lasting change.

## Right Design Consulting

*Design specialists and generalists for hire.*

**Right Design Acceleration Engagements.** Often an accelerator's real focus is on *real estate and rent*. Right Design delivers ***repeatable results***. Our team of design experts will work with you to discover and implement strategies to accelerate your time to market and meet or even beat expected delivery schedules.

**Right Design Recovery Engagements.** Your project has gone off kilter. Your design isn't connecting with customers. You don't have actionable metrics. You're not delivering on-time, or on-budget, or on-quality (or a combination of those three). A Right Design Recovery Engagement gives you the tools, knowledge and experience you need to get back on track. There are no shortcuts or silver bullets. But there are solutions given enough hard work and diligence, accompanied by good design.
