# Core Values

### Aim High

Anything worth pursuing involves risk. Seek out difficult challenges and heavier burdens to carry.

### Innovation

Sometimes innovation comes from what is new. Other times it comes from combining what is old in new ways. Be open to all possible avenues of innovation.

### Synergy

Cross pollinate across practice areas to build on the best ideas and gain new insights.

### Integrity

Build trust by keeping your commitments. Make it as right as possible when you cannot or do not.

### Humility

False humility is thinking low of yourself. True humility is discovering and owning what you are capable of, and then leveraging that in service to others.

### Empathy

Maintain a listening and learning posture, even (and especially) toward those with whom you disagree.

### Antifragility

Well designed systems gain from chaos and disorder.

### Simplicity

Accidental complexity kills systems.

### Truth Telling

Sometimes the truth is uncomfortable. Lasting trust only comes from truthfulness and candor.

### Alignment

Practice relentless self- and organizational-evaluation to measure alignment with core values, and course correct where necessary.

### Results

Get Things Done. *Tawk* is cheap if your goal is to effect real and lasting change.
